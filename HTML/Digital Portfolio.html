A digital portfolio is an onscreen way to showcase your achievements to potential employers or when applying for a course.
It is all about:
The projects you have created and developed
Your use of communication and presentation skills
Your capabilities and potential
It should have a structure that is logical and easy to navigate and must be in a format that can be uploaded and viewed on the web.
You should think of your portfolio as a shop window, carefully selecting a range of content including work done on this BTEC course as well as any other appropriate content.
Every item should be clearly introduced, explaining why it is included and what it demonstrates to the viewer. Multimedia assets should be used to enhance the experience for the viewer, not as a substitute for good content.
